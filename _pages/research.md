**This lab broadly works on the role of epigenomic mechanisms in evolutionary processes.**

<h2>Current Projects:</h2>

<h3>Transgenerational consequences of environmental exposure</h3>
Environmental pollution is a major cause of both human disease and species population declines. In order to identify populations most at risk we need to understand not only the individual consequences of pollution exposure but also the transgenerational consequences. Within the lab we use tractable arthropod model species to examine the epigenetic changes caused by pollution and to underdstand how these changes are inherited across generations. 

Currently the lab has projects ongoing projects on both pesticides and microplastics.

<h3>The role of epigenetic mechanisms in species adaptation</h3>

- Temporal population epigenetics in a freshwater crustacean.
- The relationship between the genome and epigenome: epigenetic mediated mutation.

<h2>Previous Projects:</h2>

- Gene imprinting in bumblebees, as a test for Haig's kinship theory.
- The role of DNA methylation in paternal genome elimination in mealybugs.
- Characterisation of sex-specific DNA methylation profiles in crop pest species.
