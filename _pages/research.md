**This lab broadly works on the role of epigenomic mechanisms in evolutionary processes.**

<h2>Current Projects:</h2>

<h3>Transgenerational consequences of environmental exposure</h3>
summary here

- Epigenetic responses to pollutant exposure, e.g. pesticides, microplastics.

<h3>The role of epigenetic mechanisms in species adaptation</h3>

- Temporal population epigenetics in a freshwater crustacean.
- The relationship between the genome and epigenome: epigenetic mediated mutation.

<h2>Previous Projects:</h2>

- Gene imprinting in bumblebees, as a test for Haig's kinship theory.
- The role of DNA methylation in paternal genome elimination in mealybugs.
- Characterisation of sex-specific DNA methylation profiles in crop pest species.
