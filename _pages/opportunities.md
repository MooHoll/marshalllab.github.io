<!-- <h2>Epigenetic consequences of microplastic exposure in a keystone freshwater crustacean.</h2>

I will have a project avaliable summer/autumn 2022 to analyse DNA methylation data generated from microplastic exposed <i>Daphnia magna</i>. This project is purely bioinformatic and full training will be provided.

This is an ideal project for an undergraduate/masters student dissertation, or indeed for a current PhD student wishing to add this work to their thesis. I am happy to host this project remotely and so you can be based at any University. 

If you are interested please email me at hollie_marshall@hotmail.co.uk for an informal chat.

<h2>Funded Undergraduate Summer Placement</h2>

The Genetics Society offer funded summer placements for UK students usually between their 2nd and 3rd years of study. See full details [here](https://genetics.org.uk/grants/summer-studentships/). If you would be interested in carrying out a summer project with me please contact me before the end of January (application deadline to the Genetics Society for funding is March).

<h2>Undergraduate/Masters/PhD Projects: Any Location</h2>

If you are a current student and would like to carry out a project based on my research please send me an email and we will see if we can arrange a collaboration with a member of staff at your current university.

<h2>Undergraduate and Masters Projects: University of Leicester</h2>

I am currently based at the University of Leicester and so can host current University of Leicester students for final year undergraduate projects and for masters projects. These projects would be hosted in Dr Eamonn Mallon's lab.
