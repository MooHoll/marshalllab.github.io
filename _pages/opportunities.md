<h2>Undergraduate Summer Placement</h2>

The Genetics Society offer funded summer placements for students usually between their 2nd and 3rd years of study. See full details [here](https://genetics.org.uk/grants/summer-studentships/). If you would be interested in carrying out a summer project with me please contact me before the end of January (application deadline to the Genetics Society for funding is March).

<h2>Undergraduate and Masters Projects: University of Edinburgh</h2>

I am currently based at the University of Edinburgh and so can host current University of Edinburgh students for final year undergraduate projects and for masters projects. These projects would be hosted in the [Ross Lab](https://laurarossedinburgh.weebly.com).

<h2>Undergraduate and Masters Projects: Any Location</h2>

If you are a current student and would like to carry out a project based on my research please send me an email and we will see if we can arrange a collaboration with a member of staff at your current university.
