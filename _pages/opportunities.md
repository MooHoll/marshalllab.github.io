<h2>PhD Students</h2>
I don't have any advertised projects currently, but if you're interested in carrying out a project in this lab, feel free to reach out and we can discuss.

<h2>Funded Undergraduate Summer Placement</h2>

Funded summer placements for UK students usually between their 2nd and 3rd years of study. Please note, I do not take on voluntary/unpaid projects.

[The Genetics Society](https://genetics.org.uk/grants/summer-studentships/) - deadline March.\
[MIBTP](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/mibtp/rep/) - deadline June.\
[CENTA](https://centa.ac.uk/centa-research-experience-placements-rep-2022/) - unsure of deadline.

If you would be interested in carrying out a summer project with me please contact me two months before the deadline of the funding you're interested in.

<h2>Undergraduate and Masters Projects</h2>

I can host current University of Leicester students for final year undergraduate projects and for masters projects.
