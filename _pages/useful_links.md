<h3>Learned Societies</h3>

Here are some of my favourite societies. Societies are useful to join as they usually offer travel and training grants for students. They also provide a platform for networking and keeping up to date on new research in their respective fields. Pro tip: don't pay for membership out of your own pocket use your PhD/grant funding.
