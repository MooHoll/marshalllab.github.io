<h2>Learned Societies</h2>

Here are some of my favourite societies. Societies are useful to join as they usually offer travel and training grants for students. They also provide a platform for networking and keeping up to date on new research in their respective fields. Pro tip: don't pay for membership out of your own pocket, use your PhD/grant funding.

- [Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution](https://www.smbe.org/smbe/default.aspx)
- [British Ecological Society](https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org)
- [International Union for the Study of Social Insects](http://www.iussi.org)
- [The European Society for Evolutionary Biology](https://eseb.org)
- [The Genetics Society](https://genetics.org.uk)
- [The Royal Entomological Society](https://www.royensoc.co.uk)

<h2>Fellowships</h2>

Fellowships are post-PhD opportunites to obtain your own funding to carry out an independent piece of research. They are super competative but look fantastic for your career and make obtaining a 'permanent' academic position much easier. There are various types, e.g.

- **Short-term fellowships** such as the [EMBO short-term fellowship](https://www.embo.org/funding-awards/fellowships/short-term-fellowships.html) which offers a 3month stay in another research lab. It's possible to do one of these during your PhD. There are also smaller ones such as the [Varley Gradwell Travelling Fellowship](https://www.zoo.ox.ac.uk/trustfunds#collapse405916) which supports a short project on entomology.

- **Early career fellowships** these vary dramatically and usually consist of a few years salary and some research costs. It's possible to get one straight out of PhD (e.g. [Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Actions Individual Fellowship](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/actions/individual-fellowships_en), [EMBO Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://www.embo.org/funding-awards/fellowships/postdoctoral-fellowships.html), [Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 Research Fellowship](https://www.royalcommission1851.org), [Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship](https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/early-career-fellowships), [Human Frontiers](https://www.hfsp.org/funding/hfsp-funding/postdoctoral-fellowships)) but most require a couple of years postdoc work first.
