I am broadly interested in the function of epigenetic mechanisms of non-model species, specifcally arthropods. Currently I am a postdoc based at the University of Edinburgh, UK working with Dr. Laura Ross on paternal genome elimination in the mealybug, <i>Planococcus citri</i>. I did my PhD with Dr. Eamonn Mallon at the University of Leicester, UK exploring genomic imprinting in the bumblebee, <i>Bombus terrestris</i>, as a test for Haig's kinship theory. During my PhD I also worked with Dr. Luisa Orsini at the Univeristy of Birmingham, UK exploring temporal population epigenetics of the water flea, <i>Daphnia magna</i>.

I also completed my masters degree with Dr. Luisa Orsini and Dr. Maria Cuenca-Cambronero at the Univeristy of Birmingham, UK exploring temporal genetic stability and fitness responses to eutrophication in a population of <i>Daphnia magna</i>. Last, but certainly not least, I started my academic career at the Univerity of Worcester, UK working with Dr. Mike Wheeler, where I did my dissertation on non-invasive methods of genotyping wild owl populations.

I **strongly** believe in the principles of open science and inclusion, as such I will use this website as a repository for all of my research/academic outputs. This includes things like; applications, papers, grants etc. 

I will also create a section with hints and tips for aspiring scientists. Being a 'first gen' university-goer I understand how impossible reaching a scientific career may seem. I certainly would not have got here without the support/encouragement of some awesome people! 

Finally, should you; be interested in collaboration, have an ecological epigenetics quesion or just want to talk academic careers, you can reach me at hollie_marshall@hotmail.co.uk or on twitter @MooHoll.
