 In addition to keeping all of my research in one place this website is also geared towards helping students navigate the world of academia. Academia is nothing like the working world and being a first generation student who worked for a few years before returning to science, I found the learning curve particuarly steep. Hopefully the resources I provide on this website will help demystify the academic system for those wishing to pursue a research career. 

Should you; be interested in collaboration, have an ecological epigenetics question or just want to talk academic careers, you can reach me at hollie_marshall@hotmail.co.uk or on twitter @MooHoll.
