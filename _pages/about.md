 In addition to keeping all of my research in one place this website is also geared towards helping students navigate the world of academia. Academia is nothing like the working world and being a first generation student who worked for a few years before returning to science, I found the learning curve particuarly steep. Hopefully the resources I provide on this website will help demystify the academic system for those wishing to pursue a research career. 

Should you; be interested in collaboration, have an ecological epigenetics question or just want to talk academic careers, you can reach me at hollie_marshall@hotmail.co.uk or on twitter @MooHoll.

**My background:** I am broadly interested in the function of epigenetic mechanisms in non-model species, specifically arthropods. Currently I am a postdoc based at the University of Edinburgh, UK working with Dr. Laura Ross on paternal genome elimination in the mealybug, <i>Planococcus citri</i>. I did my PhD with Dr. Eamonn Mallon at the University of Leicester, UK exploring genomic imprinting in the bumblebee, <i>Bombus terrestris</i>, as a test for Haig's kinship theory. During my PhD I also worked with Dr. Luisa Orsini at the University of Birmingham, UK exploring temporal population epigenetics of the water flea, <i>Daphnia magna</i>.

I also completed my masters degree with Dr. Luisa Orsini and Dr. Maria Cuenca-Cambronero at the University of Birmingham, UK exploring temporal genetic stability and fitness responses to eutrophication in a population of <i>Daphnia magna</i>. Last, but certainly not least, I started my academic career at the University of Worcester, UK working with Dr. Mike Wheeler, where I did my dissertation on non-invasive methods of genotyping wild owl populations.
