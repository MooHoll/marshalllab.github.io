This lab uses a combination of experimental lab work and natural population studies to explore the below areas. Our main approach is through the generation and analysis of sequencing data - i.e. wet lab work paired with bioinformatics.

This website is also geared towards providing resources for students and ECRs (early career researchers) to help them navigate the 'unspoke rules' of academia.
